Pure Python Data Analysis &amp; Recommendation System

Developed an end-to-end data processing and recommendation system using only core Python, without any external libraries.
Cleaned and structured raw user data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.
Implemented the “People You May Know” feature using mutual friend analysis to suggest potential connections.
Built the “Pages You Might Like” recommendation engine using collaborative filtering to suggest relevant pages based on user interest overlap.
